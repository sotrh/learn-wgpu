# Update to Winit 0.30!

If you've been watching [the winit update tracker](https://github.com/sotrh/learn-wgpu/issues/503), you'll likely be happy to see this update!

## It's been a long time coming

Up and to this point I've had winit locked at version 0.29. The reason for this was that the update to 0.30 broke a lot of things and I haven't had the time to go through and fix everything. On top of that I was having trouble with getting the canvas correctly.

The bulk of [tutorial 2](../../beginner/tutorial2-surface/) has changed so head there to see what's new.

Not much has changed on Wgpu itself, so I'll leave it there.

I'd like to shout out my top patrons!
