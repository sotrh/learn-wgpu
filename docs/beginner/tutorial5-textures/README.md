# Textures and bind groups

Up to this point, we have been drawing super simple shapes. While we can make a game with just triangles, trying to draw highly detailed objects would massively limit what devices could even run our game. However, we can get around this problem with **textures**.

Textures are images overlaid on a triangle mesh to make it seem more detailed. There are multiple types of textures, such as normal maps, bump maps, specular maps, and diffuse maps. We're going to talk about diffuse maps or, more simply, the color texture.

## Loading an image from a file

If we want to map an image to our mesh, we first need an image. Let's use this happy little tree:

![a happy tree](./happy-tree.png)

We'll use the [image crate](https://docs.rs/image) to load our tree. Let's add it to our dependencies:

```toml
[dependencies.image]
version = "0.24"
default-features = false
features = ["png", "jpeg"]
```

The jpeg decoder that `image` includes uses [rayon](https://docs.rs/rayon) to speed up the decoding with threads. WASM doesn't support threads currently, so we need to disable this so our code won't crash when we try to load a jpeg on the web.

<div class="note">

Decoding jpegs in WASM isn't very performant. If you want to speed up image loading in general in WASM, you could opt to use the browser's built-in decoders instead of `image` when building with `wasm-bindgen`. This will involve creating an `<img>` tag in Rust to get the image and then a `<canvas>` to get the pixel data, but I'll leave this as an exercise for the reader.

</div>

In `State`'s `new()` method, add the following just after configuring the `surface`:

```rust
surface.configure(&device, &config);
// NEW!

let diffuse_bytes = include_bytes!("happy-tree.png");
let diffuse_image = image::load_from_memory(diffuse_bytes).unwrap();
let diffuse_rgba = diffuse_image.to_rgba8();

use image::GenericImageView;
let dimensions = diffuse_image.dimensions();
```

Here, we grab the bytes from our image file and load them into an image, which is then converted into a `Vec` of RGBA bytes. We also save the image's dimensions for when we create the actual `Texture`.

Now, let's create the `Texture`:

```rust
let texture_size = wgpu::Extent3d {
    width: dimensions.0,
    height: dimensions.1,
    // All textures are stored as 3D, we represent our 2D texture
    // by setting depth to 1.
    depth_or_array_layers: 1,
};
let diffuse_texture = device.create_texture(
    &wgpu::TextureDescriptor {
        size: texture_size,
        mip_level_count: 1, // We'll talk about this a little later
        sample_count: 1,
        dimension: wgpu::TextureDimension::D2,
        // Most images are stored using sRGB, so we need to reflect that here.
        format: wgpu::TextureFormat::Rgba8UnormSrgb,
        // TEXTURE_BINDING tells wgpu that we want to use this texture in shaders
        // COPY_DST means that we want to copy data to this texture
        usage: wgpu::TextureUsages::TEXTURE_BINDING | wgpu::TextureUsages::COPY_DST,
        label: Some("diffuse_texture"),
        // This is the same as with the SurfaceConfig. It
        // specifies what texture formats can be used to
        // create TextureViews for this texture. The base
        // texture format (Rgba8UnormSrgb in this case) is
        // always supported. Note that using a different
        // texture format is not supported on the WebGL2
        // backend.
        view_formats: &[],
    }
);
```

## Getting data into a Texture

The `Texture` struct has no methods to interact with the data directly. However, we can use a method on the `queue` we created earlier called `write_texture` to load in the texture. Let's take a look at how we do that:

```rust
queue.write_texture(
    // Tells wgpu where to copy the pixel data
    wgpu::TexelCopyTextureInfo {
        texture: &diffuse_texture,
        mip_level: 0,
        origin: wgpu::Origin3d::ZERO,
        aspect: wgpu::TextureAspect::All,
    },
    // The actual pixel data
    &diffuse_rgba,
    // The layout of the texture
    wgpu::TexelCopyBufferLayout {
        offset: 0,
        bytes_per_row: Some(4 * dimensions.0),
        rows_per_image: Some(dimensions.1),
    },
    texture_size,
);
```

<div class="note">

The old way of writing data to a texture was to copy the pixel data to a buffer and then copy it to the texture. Using `write_texture` is a bit more efficient as it uses one buffer less - I'll leave it here, though, in case you need it.

```rust
let buffer = device.create_buffer_init(
    &wgpu::util::BufferInitDescriptor {
        label: Some("Temp Buffer"),
        contents: &diffuse_rgba,
        usage: wgpu::BufferUsages::COPY_SRC,
    }
);

let mut encoder = device.create_command_encoder(&wgpu::CommandEncoderDescriptor {
    label: Some("texture_buffer_copy_encoder"),
});

encoder.copy_buffer_to_texture(
    wgpu::TexelCopyBufferInfo {
        buffer: &buffer,
        offset: 0,
        bytes_per_row: 4 * dimensions.0,
        rows_per_image: dimensions.1,
    },
    wgpu::TexelCopyTextureInfo {
        texture: &diffuse_texture,
        mip_level: 0,
        array_layer: 0,
        origin: wgpu::Origin3d::ZERO,
    },
    size,
);

queue.submit(std::iter::once(encoder.finish()));
```

The `bytes_per_row` field needs some consideration. This value needs to be a multiple of 256. Check out [the gif tutorial](../../showcase/gifs/#how-do-we-make-the-frames) for more details.

</div>

## TextureViews and Samplers

Now that our texture has data in it, we need a way to use it. This is where a `TextureView` and a `Sampler` come in. A `TextureView` offers us a *view* into our texture. A `Sampler` controls how the `Texture` is *sampled*. Sampling works similar to the eyedropper tool in GIMP/Photoshop. Our program supplies a coordinate on the texture (known as a *texture coordinate*), and the sampler then returns the corresponding color based on the texture and some internal parameters.

Let's define our `diffuse_texture_view` and `diffuse_sampler` now:

```rust
// We don't need to configure the texture view much, so let's
// let wgpu define it.
let diffuse_texture_view = diffuse_texture.create_view(&wgpu::TextureViewDescriptor::default());
let diffuse_sampler = device.create_sampler(&wgpu::SamplerDescriptor {
    address_mode_u: wgpu::AddressMode::ClampToEdge,
    address_mode_v: wgpu::AddressMode::ClampToEdge,
    address_mode_w: wgpu::AddressMode::ClampToEdge,
    mag_filter: wgpu::FilterMode::Linear,
    min_filter: wgpu::FilterMode::Nearest,
    mipmap_filter: wgpu::FilterMode::Nearest,
    ..Default::default()
});
```

The `address_mode_*` parameters determine what to do if the sampler gets a texture coordinate that's outside the texture itself. We have a few options to choose from:

* `ClampToEdge`: Any texture coordinates outside the texture will return the color of the nearest pixel on the edges of the texture.
* `Repeat`: The texture will repeat as texture coordinates exceed the texture's dimensions.
* `MirrorRepeat`: Similar to `Repeat`, but the image will flip when going over boundaries.

![address_mode.png](./address_mode.png)

The `mag_filter` and `min_filter` fields describe what to do when the sample footprint is smaller or larger than one texel. These two fields usually work when the mapping in the scene is far from or close to the camera.

There are two options:
* `Linear`: Select two texels in each dimension and return a linear interpolation between their values.
* `Nearest`: Return the texel value nearest to the texture coordinates. This creates an image that's crisper from far away but pixelated up close. This can be desirable, however, if your textures are designed to be pixelated, like in pixel art games or voxel games like Minecraft.

Mipmaps are a complex topic and will require their own section in the future. For now, we can say that `mipmap_filter` functions are similar to `(mag/min)_filter` as it tells the sampler how to blend between mipmaps.

I'm using some defaults for the other fields. If you want to see what they are, check [the wgpu docs](https://docs.rs/wgpu/latest/wgpu/struct.SamplerDescriptor.html).

All these different resources are nice and all, but they don't do us much good if we can't plug them in anywhere. This is where `BindGroup`s and `PipelineLayout`s come in.

## The BindGroup

A `BindGroup` describes a set of resources and how they can be accessed by a shader. We create a `BindGroup` using a `BindGroupLayout`. Let's make one of those first.

```rust
let texture_bind_group_layout =
            device.create_bind_group_layout(&wgpu::BindGroupLayoutDescriptor {
                entries: &[
                    wgpu::BindGroupLayoutEntry {
                        binding: 0,
                        visibility: wgpu::ShaderStages::FRAGMENT,
                        ty: wgpu::BindingType::Texture {
                            multisampled: false,
                            view_dimension: wgpu::TextureViewDimension::D2,
                            sample_type: wgpu::TextureSampleType::Float { filterable: true },
                        },
                        count: None,
                    },
                    wgpu::BindGroupLayoutEntry {
                        binding: 1,
                        visibility: wgpu::ShaderStages::FRAGMENT,
                        // This should match the filterable field of the
                        // corresponding Texture entry above.
                        ty: wgpu::BindingType::Sampler(wgpu::SamplerBindingType::Filtering),
                        count: None,
                    },
                ],
                label: Some("texture_bind_group_layout"),
            });
```

Our `texture_bind_group_layout` has two entries: one for a sampled texture at binding 0 and one for a sampler at binding 1. Both of these bindings are visible only to the fragment shader as specified by `FRAGMENT`. The possible values for this field are any bitwise combination of `NONE`, `VERTEX`, `FRAGMENT`, or `COMPUTE`. Most of the time, we'll only use `FRAGMENT` for textures and samplers, but it's good to know what else is available.

With `texture_bind_group_layout`, we can now create our `BindGroup`:

```rust
let diffuse_bind_group = device.create_bind_group(
    &wgpu::BindGroupDescriptor {
        layout: &texture_bind_group_layout,
        entries: &[
            wgpu::BindGroupEntry {
                binding: 0,
                resource: wgpu::BindingResource::TextureView(&diffuse_texture_view),
            },
            wgpu::BindGroupEntry {
                binding: 1,
                resource: wgpu::BindingResource::Sampler(&diffuse_sampler),
            }
        ],
        label: Some("diffuse_bind_group"),
    }
);
```

Looking at this, you might get a bit of déjà vu! That's because a `BindGroup` is a more specific declaration of the `BindGroupLayout`. The reason they're separate is that it allows us to swap out `BindGroup`s on the fly, so long as they all share the same `BindGroupLayout`. Each texture and sampler we create will need to be added to a `BindGroup`. For our purposes, we'll create a new bind group for each texture.

Now that we have our `diffuse_bind_group`, let's add it to our `State` struct:

```rust
struct State<'a> {
    surface: wgpu::Surface<'a>,
    device: wgpu::Device,
    queue: wgpu::Queue,
    config: wgpu::SurfaceConfiguration,
    size: winit::dpi::PhysicalSize<u32>,
    window: &'a wgpu::Window,
    render_pipeline: wgpu::RenderPipeline,
    vertex_buffer: wgpu::Buffer,
    index_buffer: wgpu::Buffer,
    num_indices: u32,
    diffuse_bind_group: wgpu::BindGroup, // NEW!
}
```

Make sure we return these fields in the `new` method:

```rust
impl<'a> State<'a> {
    async fn new() -> Self {
        // ...
        Self {
            surface,
            device,
            queue,
            config,
            size,
            window,
            render_pipeline,
            vertex_buffer,
            index_buffer,
            num_indices,
            // NEW!
            diffuse_bind_group,
        }
    }
}
```

Now that we've got our `BindGroup`, we can use it in our `render()` function.

```rust
// render()
// ...
render_pass.set_pipeline(&self.render_pipeline);
render_pass.set_bind_group(0, &self.diffuse_bind_group, &[]); // NEW!
render_pass.set_vertex_buffer(0, self.vertex_buffer.slice(..));
render_pass.set_index_buffer(self.index_buffer.slice(..), wgpu::IndexFormat::Uint16);

render_pass.draw_indexed(0..self.num_indices, 0, 0..1);
```

## PipelineLayout

Remember the `PipelineLayout` we created back in [the pipeline section](/learn-wgpu/beginner/tutorial3-pipeline#how-do-we-use-the-shaders)? Now, we finally get to use it! The `PipelineLayout` contains a list of `BindGroupLayout`s that the pipeline can use. Modify `render_pipeline_layout` to use our `texture_bind_group_layout`.

```rust
async fn new(...) {
    // ...
    let render_pipeline_layout = device.create_pipeline_layout(
        &wgpu::PipelineLayoutDescriptor {
            label: Some("Render Pipeline Layout"),
            bind_group_layouts: &[&texture_bind_group_layout], // NEW!
            push_constant_ranges: &[],
        }
    );
    // ...
}
```

## A change to the VERTICES
There are a few things we need to change about our `Vertex` definition. Up to now, we've been using a `color` attribute to set the color of our mesh. Now that we're using a texture, we want to replace our `color` with `tex_coords`. These coordinates will then be passed to the `Sampler` to retrieve the appropriate color.

Since our `tex_coords` are two-dimensional, we'll change the field to take two floats instead of three.

First, we'll change the `Vertex` struct:

```rust
#[repr(C)]
#[derive(Copy, Clone, Debug, bytemuck::Pod, bytemuck::Zeroable)]
struct Vertex {
    position: [f32; 3],
    tex_coords: [f32; 2], // NEW!
}
```

And then reflect these changes in the `VertexBufferLayout`:

```rust
impl Vertex {
    fn desc() -> wgpu::VertexBufferLayout<'static> {
        use std::mem;
        wgpu::VertexBufferLayout {
            array_stride: mem::size_of::<Vertex>() as wgpu::BufferAddress,
            step_mode: wgpu::VertexStepMode::Vertex,
            attributes: &[
                wgpu::VertexAttribute {
                    offset: 0,
                    shader_location: 0,
                    format: wgpu::VertexFormat::Float32x3,
                },
                wgpu::VertexAttribute {
                    offset: mem::size_of::<[f32; 3]>() as wgpu::BufferAddress,
                    shader_location: 1,
                    format: wgpu::VertexFormat::Float32x2, // NEW!
                },
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

Lastly, we need to change `VERTICES` itself. Replace the existing definition with the following:

```rust
// Changed
const VERTICES: &[Vertex] = &[
    Vertex { position: [-0.0868241, 0.49240386, 0.0], tex_coords: [0.4131759, 0.99240386], }, // A
    Vertex { position: [-0.49513406, 0.06958647, 0.0], tex_coords: [0.0048659444, 0.56958647], }, // B
    Vertex { position: [-0.21918549, -0.44939706, 0.0], tex_coords: [0.28081453, 0.05060294], }, // C
    Vertex { position: [0.35966998, -0.3473291, 0.0], tex_coords: [0.85967, 0.1526709], }, // D
    Vertex { position: [0.44147372, 0.2347359, 0.0], tex_coords: [0.9414737, 0.7347359], }, // E
];
```

## Shader time

With our new `Vertex` structure in place, it's time to update our shaders. We'll first need to pass our `tex_coords` into the vertex shader and then use them over to our fragment shader to get the final color from the `Sampler`. Let's start with the vertex shader:

```wgsl
// Vertex shader

struct VertexInput {
    @location(0) position: vec3<f32>,
    @location(1) tex_coords: vec2<f32>,
}

struct VertexOutput {
    @builtin(position) clip_position: vec4<f32>,
    @location(0) tex_coords: vec2<f32>,
}

@vertex
fn vs_main(
    model: VertexInput,
) -> VertexOutput {
    var out: VertexOutput;
    out.tex_coords = model.tex_coords;
    out.clip_position = vec4<f32>(model.position, 1.0);
    return out;
}
```

Now that we have our vertex shader outputting our `tex_coords`, we need to change the fragment shader to take them in. With these coordinates, we'll finally be able to use our sampler to get a color from our texture.

```wgsl
// Fragment shader

@group(0) @binding(0)
var t_diffuse: texture_2d<f32>;
@group(0) @binding(1)
var s_diffuse: sampler;

@fragment
fn fs_main(in: VertexOutput) -> @location(0) vec4<f32> {
    return textureSample(t_diffuse, s_diffuse, in.tex_coords);
}
```

The variables `t_diffuse` and `s_diffuse` are what's known as uniforms. We'll go over uniforms more in the [cameras section](/beginner/tutorial6-uniforms/). For now, all we need to know is that `group()` corresponds to the 1st parameter in `set_bind_group()` and `binding()` relates to the `binding` specified when we created the `BindGroupLayout` and `BindGroup`.

## The results

If we run our program now, we should get the following result:

![an upside down tree on a pentagon](./upside-down.png)

That's weird. Our tree is upside down! This is because wgpu's world coordinates have the y-axis pointing up, while texture coordinates have the y-axis pointing down. In other words, (0, 0) in texture coordinates corresponds to the top-left of the image, while (1, 1) is the bottom right.

![happy-tree-uv-coords.png](./happy-tree-uv-coords.png)

We can get our triangle right-side up by replacing the y coordinate `y` of each texture coordinate with `1 - y`:

```rust
const VERTICES: &[Vertex] = &[
    // Changed
    Vertex { position: [-0.0868241, 0.49240386, 0.0], tex_coords: [0.4131759, 0.00759614], }, // A
    Vertex { position: [-0.49513406, 0.06958647, 0.0], tex_coords: [0.0048659444, 0.43041354], }, // B
    Vertex { position: [-0.21918549, -0.44939706, 0.0], tex_coords: [0.28081453, 0.949397], }, // C
    Vertex { position: [0.35966998, -0.3473291, 0.0], tex_coords: [0.85967, 0.84732914], }, // D
    Vertex { position: [0.44147372, 0.2347359, 0.0], tex_coords: [0.9414737, 0.2652641], }, // E
];
```

With that in place, we now have our tree right-side up on our pentagon:

![our happy tree as it should be](./rightside-up.png)

## Cleaning things up

For convenience, let's pull our texture code into its own module. We'll first need to add the [anyhow](https://docs.rs/anyhow/) crate to our `Cargo.toml` file to simplify error handling;

```toml
[dependencies]
image = "0.23"
cgmath = "0.18"
winit = { version = "0.29", features = ["android-native-activity"] }
env_logger = "0.10"
log = "0.4"
pollster = "0.3"
wgpu = "25.0"
bytemuck = { version = "1.16", features = [ "derive" ] }
anyhow = "1.0" # NEW!
```

Then, in a new file called `src/texture.rs`, add the following:

```rust
use image::GenericImageView;
use anyhow::*;

pub struct Texture {
    #[allow(unused)]
    pub texture: wgpu::Texture,
    pub view: wgpu::TextureView,
    pub sampler: wgpu::Sampler,
}

impl Texture {
    pub fn from_bytes(
        device: &wgpu::Device,
        queue: &wgpu::Queue,
        bytes: &[u8], 
        label: &str
    ) -> Result<Self> {
        let img = image::load_from_memory(bytes)?;
        Self::from_image(device, queue, &img, Some(label))
    }

    pub fn from_image(
        device: &wgpu::Device,
        queue: &wgpu::Queue,
        img: &image::DynamicImage,
        label: Option<&str>
    ) -> Result<Self> {
        let rgba = img.to_rgba8();
        let dimensions = img.dimensions();

        let size = wgpu::Extent3d {
            width: dimensions.0,
            height: dimensions.1,
            depth_or_array_layers: 1,
        };
        let texture = device.create_texture(
            &wgpu::TextureDescriptor {
                label,
                size,
                mip_level_count: 1,
                sample_count: 1,
                dimension: wgpu::TextureDimension::D2,
                format: wgpu::TextureFormat::Rgba8UnormSrgb,
                usage: wgpu::TextureUsages::TEXTURE_BINDING | wgpu::TextureUsages::COPY_DST,
                view_formats: &[],
            }
        );

        queue.write_texture(
            wgpu::TexelCopyTextureInfo {
                aspect: wgpu::TextureAspect::All,
                texture: &texture,
                mip_level: 0,
                origin: wgpu::Origin3d::ZERO,
            },

<div class="note">

Notice that we're using `to_rgba8()` instead of `as_rgba8()`. PNGs work fine with `as_rgba8()`, as they have an alpha channel. But JPEGs don't have an alpha channel, and the code would panic if we try to call `as_rgba8()` on the JPEG texture image we are going to use. Instead, we can use `to_rgba8()` to handle such an image, which will generate a new image buffer with an alpha channel even if the original image does not have one.

</div>

We need to import `texture.rs` as a module, so at the top of `lib.rs` add the following.

```rust
mod texture;
```

The texture creation code in `new()` now gets a lot simpler:

```rust
surface.configure(&device, &config);
let diffuse_bytes = include_bytes!("happy-tree.png"); // CHANGED!
let diffuse_texture = texture::Texture::from_bytes(&device, &queue, diffuse_bytes, "happy-tree.png").unwrap(); // CHANGED!

// Everything up until `let texture_bind_group_layout = ...` can now be removed.
```

We still need to store the bind group separately so that `Texture` doesn't need to know how the `BindGroup` is laid out. The creation of `diffuse_bind_group` slightly changes to use the `view` and `sampler` fields of `diffuse_texture`:

```rust
let diffuse_bind_group = device.create_bind_group(
    &wgpu::BindGroupDescriptor {
        layout: &texture_bind_group_layout,
        entries: &[
            wgpu::BindGroupEntry {
                binding: 0,
                resource: wgpu::BindingResource::TextureView(&diffuse_texture.view), // CHANGED!
            },
            wgpu::BindGroupEntry {
                binding: 1,
                resource: wgpu::BindingResource::Sampler(&diffuse_texture.sampler), // CHANGED!
            }
        ],
        label: Some("diffuse_bind_group"),
    }
);
```

Finally, let's update our `State` field to use our shiny new `Texture` struct, as we'll need it in future tutorials.

```rust
struct State {
    // ...
    diffuse_bind_group: wgpu::BindGroup,
    diffuse_texture: texture::Texture, // NEW
}
```

```rust
impl<'a> State<'a> {
    async fn new() -> Self {
        // ...
        Self {
            // ...
            num_indices,
            diffuse_bind_group,
            diffuse_texture, // NEW
        }
    }
}
```

Phew!

With these changes in place, the code should be working the same as before, but we now have a much easier way to create textures.

## Challenge

Create another texture and swap it out when you press the space key.
